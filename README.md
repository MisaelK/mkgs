#### Installing as a bookmarklet
(copied from the [Twitch.TV Chat Filter readme](https://github.com/jpgohlke/twitch-chat-filter/blob/master/README.md), using [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com))

Fast and lightweight way to run the script.

1. Go to the bookmark menu of your browser and add a new bookmark with the title of your choice.

2. Copy the following snippet and paste it into the URL-Field: `javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgit.com/MisaelK/mkgs/master/ThaSauce%20Compo%20Playlist.user.js';})();`

3. Save the Bookmark.

4. From now on, you can just click on that bookmark when you have the thaSauce compo open to enable the script.
